# Implementation Plan: Ocean Hazard Crowdsource Platform Prototype

---

## 1. Project Title and Goal

**Title:** Integrated Platform for Crowdsourced Ocean Hazard Reporting and Social Media Analytics

> **Goal:** To create a working prototype of a "Waze for coastal disasters" platform that provides real-time, ground-level information to emergency responders by collecting, processing, and visualizing crowdsourced data and social media feeds.

---

## 2. Prototype (MVP) Scope

The initial prototype will focus on delivering the core functionality to prove the concept. It will include:

* A web-based application for citizen hazard reporting.
* A backend service to receive and store reports.
* A simple database to store the hazard reports.
* A dashboard for officials with a map to visualize the reported hazards in real-time.
* A simplified social media integration to fetch posts based on keywords.

---

## 3. Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** React (with a mapping library like Leaflet or Mapbox) for a responsive and interactive user interface.
* **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js for a fast and scalable API.
* **Database:** MongoDB or PostgreSQL with PostGIS for storing geospatial data.
* **Social Media Integration:** Twitter API (or another accessible social media API) for fetching public posts.
* **Deployment:** Heroku or Netlify for easy deployment of the prototype.

## 4. Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Backend and Database Setup

1. **Initialize a Node.js project:** Set up a new Node.js project with Express.js.
2. **Design the database schema:** Create a schema for hazard reports.

    ```json
    {
      "hazardType": "String",
      "description": "String",
      "location": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": ["Number", "Number"]
      },
      "timestamp": "Date",
      "media": "String",
      "source": "String",
      "status": "String"
    }
    ```

3. **Set up the database:** Create a new database (MongoDB Atlas or a local PostgreSQL instance).
4. **Create API endpoints:**

```http
POST /api/reports
GET /api/reports
```

### Phase 2: Frontend Web App for Citizen Reporting

1. **Create a React application:** Set up a new React project.
2. **Build the reporting form:** Create a form with fields for hazard type, description, and location (can be automatically fetched from the browser's geolocation API).
3. **Integrate with the backend:** Connect the form to the `POST /api/reports` endpoint to submit new reports.
4. **Add a map for location picking:** Allow users to pinpoint the location of the hazard on a map.

### Phase 3: Official Dashboard for Visualization

1. **Create a new page/component for the dashboard.**
2. **Fetch data from the backend:** Use the `GET /api/reports` endpoint to get all hazard reports.
3. **Integrate a map:** Use a mapping library (Leaflet, Mapbox) to display the reports as markers on a map.
4. **Implement basic filtering:** Add filters to the dashboard to allow officials to filter reports by `hazardType` or `timestamp`.
5. **Display report details:** When a marker on the map is clicked, display the details of the report.

### Phase 4: Basic Social Media Integration (Simplified for prototype)

1. **Set up a script:** Create a backend script that runs periodically (e.g., every 5 minutes).
2. **Connect to a social media API:** Use the Twitter API to search for public posts containing relevant keywords (e.g., "tsunami", "flooding" + location names).
3. **Process and store the data:** For each relevant post, create a new entry in the database with the `source` as 'SocialMedia'. The location might be extracted from the post content if available.
4. **Display on the dashboard:** The dashboard will automatically display the social media posts on the map alongside the citizen reports.

## 5. Key Features in the Prototype

* **Citizen Reporting:** A simple web form to submit hazard reports.
* **Geolocation:** Automatic capture of user's location.
* **Database Storage:** Reports are stored in a central database.
* **Real-time Map Dashboard:** A live map showing the location of all reported hazards.
* **Basic Filtering:** Ability to filter reports on the dashboard.
* **Simplified Social Media Monitoring:** Periodically fetches and displays relevant social media posts.

## 6. Future Enhancements (Post-Prototype)

* **Native Mobile Apps (iOS/Android):** For better user experience and offline capabilities.
* **Advanced AI/ML for Verification:** An AI model to analyze reports and social media data to assign a "trust score" and identify hotspots automatically.
* **SMS and IVR Integration:** To allow reporting via text messages and phone calls.
* **User Reputation System:** To improve the reliability of reports.
* **Push Notifications:** To send verified alerts to users.
* **Peer-to-Peer Mesh Networking:** For communication in areas with no network coverage.
* **"Peacetime" Features:** Daily tide times, weather forecasts, etc., to increase user engagement.
