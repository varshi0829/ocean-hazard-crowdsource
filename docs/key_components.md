# Key Components

## "Integrated Platform for Crowdsourced Ocean Hazard Reporting and Social Media Analytics"

**Key Components:**

### 1. Integrated Platform**

* Single unified system (not separate tools)
* Combines multiple data sources and functions
* Works across mobile and web

### 2. Crowdsourced Ocean Hazard Reporting

* Citizens report what they see: unusual waves, flooding, tsunamis
* Real-time field observations from people on the ground
* Geotagged reports with photos/videos
* Fills gaps where official sensors/satellites can't reach

### 3. Social Media Analytics**

* Monitors Twitter, Facebook, YouTube for hazard discussions
* Uses AI/NLP to detect relevant posts about ocean dangers
* Tracks public sentiment and awareness during events
* Identifies trending hazard-related keywords

### The Problem It Solves:**

INCOIS has great satellite/sensor data but lacks real-time ground truth from people. Social media has valuable insights but it's scattered and unanalyzed. Your platform bridges this gap by:

* Getting direct reports from citizens experiencing hazards
* Mining social media for additional situational awareness
* Combining both into actionable intelligence for disaster response

**Real Example:** Tsunami hits → Citizens report flooding via your app → Social media shows panic/evacuation posts → Emergency teams get complete picture faster than relying on sensors alone.
