# Potential Drawbacks of the Current Project Plan

This document outlines potential weaknesses and challenges in the current implementation plan. Addressing these points will lead to a more robust and effective platform.

## 1. Over-Reliance on High-Tech Users

* **The Drawback:** The initial prototype focuses on a web application and later a smartphone app. This approach risks excluding the most vulnerable members of coastal communities who may not own smartphones or have reliable internet access.
* **The Impact:** The platform might fail to gather information from the people who are most affected by a disaster, leading to an incomplete picture of the situation.

### 2. The Challenge of Data Verification

* **The Drawback:** The plan mentions a "trust engine" but doesn't specify how it will work. Without a robust system to verify information, the platform is highly susceptible to misinformation, spam, and panic-driven false reports.
* **The Impact:** If officials cannot trust the data, the entire platform becomes unreliable. A single, high-profile false report that causes a panic or misdirects resources could damage the system's credibility permanently.

### 3. The "Noise" of Social Media Analytics

* **The Drawback:** The plan to scan all public social media for keywords is challenging. Social media is incredibly "noisy," and it is difficult to distinguish between relevant, on-the-ground reports and irrelevant noise (news articles, old posts, discussions about other locations).
* **The Impact:** The dashboard could be flooded with low-quality or irrelevant information, distracting officials and making it harder to spot the critical, authentic reports.

### 4. Complex Reporting Process Under Stress

* **The Drawback:** A reporting form with several fields (hazard type, description, location, media) can be too slow and complicated for someone to use during a stressful, life-threatening emergency.
* **The Impact:** Users may abandon the reporting process if it's not quick and intuitive. The platform might lose critical, time-sensitive information simply because the process was not designed for use under extreme duress.
