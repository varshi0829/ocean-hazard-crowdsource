# Description

Think of this project as creating **"Waze for coastal disasters."** It’s a system to get real-time information from people on the ground during an ocean emergency, like a tsunami or major flood.

## The Problem

Right now, INCOIS can predict that a big wave is coming (the **official warning**), but they don't know exactly which specific villages are flooding *right now* or how people are reacting (the **ground reality**). They are missing crucial live information from the scene.

### The Solution

Build a unified platform (a mobile app and a website) that does two main things:

**1. Get Reports Directly from the Ground**
This lets people on the coast be the "eyes and ears" for emergency services.

* Anyone with the app can quickly report what they see (e.g., "The water is in the market," "A bridge has been damaged").
* They can include photos, videos, and their exact location with the report.
* It even works offline, saving the report and sending it as soon as a connection is available.

**2. Listen to Social Media Buzz**
The platform automatically scans public social media (like Twitter, Facebook, etc.) for keywords related to the disaster ("tsunami," "flooding," "big waves" in various languages).

* It uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to figure out where people are talking about the hazard and what the general feeling (sentiment) is—are they panicked, asking for help, or just sharing news?

### Bringing It All Together: The Dashboard

All this information—from both citizen reports and social media—is put onto a single, live dashboard with a map for emergency officials.

* **Live Map:** Officials can see reports popping up on a map in real-time.
* **Hotspots:** If many reports and panicked tweets come from one particular village, that area will automatically light up as a **"hotspot,"** telling officials, "Pay attention here! The situation is serious."
* **Filters:** An official can filter the map to see only reports about "flooding" or view all activity from the last hour.

### The Ultimate Goal

The goal is to give emergency responders a **complete, real-time picture of what's happening on the ground.** This helps them make faster, smarter decisions—like where to send rescue teams first, which areas need immediate evacuation, and how to correct misinformation—ultimately helping to save lives.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The platform is designed to track a wide range of **ocean hazards**. The goal is to get on-the-ground reports for **any** unusual or dangerous event happening at the coastline.

This includes:

* **Tsunamis:** The most critical type of event.
* **Storm Surges:** The abnormal rise of water generated by a storm, over and above the predicted tides.
* **High Waves & Swell Surges:** Unusually large or powerful waves hitting the coast, which can be dangerous for people and boats.
* **Strong Coastal Currents:** Unexpectedly strong currents that can pose a risk.
* **Coastal Damage:** Reports of things like rapid beach erosion or damage to coastal structures caused by the ocean.
* **Any other abnormal sea behavior:** Anything that a local resident would notice as unusual and potentially dangerous.

Flooding is often the *result* of these events (like a storm surge or tsunami), but the system is designed to capture information about the entire event, not just the flooding itself.
